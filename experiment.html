      Use MathML to write the formula for Einstein's famous formula E=mc2 (5
      points)

      Despite being in the HTML specification since a long time, developers
      could not make use of it until recently. Explain why that might be the
      case (Hint: Check the caniuse.com page for MathML!) (5 points)
    </h2>

    <p>
      Firefox has had native MathML support for years, but Chrome, Edge, and
      Safari had little or no support. Google Chrome (the most widely used
      browser) only started improving MathML support in 2023. This means MathML
      elements were often rendered differently depending on the browser, making
      it unreliable for web applications.
